# CI/CD - JAMStack EMF Workshop 🔥

👨🏻‍💻EMF Students. This branch is for the introduction section of the workshop.

Instructions:
1. Login to GatsbyJS with your GitHub credentials.

2. Say yes to I already have a gatsby site. Accept permissions to install Gatsby Cloud in your account, but allow it to only your repo.

3. Select the correct repo Where it asks you to 
   select a repository, accept the defaults and hit next. 
   Skip the next step about adding a CMS. And don’t worry about the environment variables step. 

4. You should then come to the main dashboard page. Where you will see Gatsby has triggered a build on the branch you've been working on.  
5. Test your configuration is working by editing your local repo with some new commits and push them to your branch. 
   After pushing, check your gatsby cloud main dash. You should now see Gatsby is building and when finished, 
   provide you with a URL.

💥You should now be all set up with Gatsby Cloud!

Note: If you don't see Gatsby Cloud dash building your branch, push your changes on Master branch. On the free plan, Gatsby only allows branch previews for a certain amount of time (14 days I think).
